**Tock** is a research-oriented implementation of a blockchain system. It is not intended for use in production environments or to be integrated into any codebase.

This repository contains the entire codebase written in Go (Golang). I'll soon provide a detailed explanation of why Go was chosen for this project.

If you're looking to learn or explore how complex blockchain systems work, you're in the right place to begin your discovery journey.
